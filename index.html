      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Alcoholism among college students is a growing concern. This site explores its causes, effects, and potential solutions while also providing resources for those who may be struggling with alcohol addiction.</p>
    </section>

   <section id="causes">
  <h2>Causes</h2>
  <p>Excessive drinking on college campuses is often caused by a combination of psychological, social, and environmental factors. Here are the most significant contributors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Peer Pressure:</strong> College often brings newfound independence and social opportunities, but it can also lead to pressure to conform to group norms. This includes risky behaviors like heavy drinking, especially during social gatherings or parties. This pressure often drives students to partake in unsafe drinking practices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stress and Academic Pressure:</strong> The challenges of balancing academics, jobs, and personal life can overwhelm students. Many turn to alcohol as a temporary escape from stress or anxiety, leading to patterns of excessive drinking that can spiral out of control.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Social Acceptance and Identity:</strong> The desire to fit in and feel accepted can push students to drink. Alcohol is often seen as a way to ease social interactions, especially for new students trying to establish themselves in the campus community.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Role of Fraternities and Sororities:</strong> Greek life can sometimes promote harmful drinking behaviors. Hazing rituals and events often normalize heavy drinking, creating environments where students feel obligated to drink excessively to gain acceptance or prove loyalty.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cultural and Environmental Influences:</strong> Broader societal factors, such as the glamorization of college partying in movies and media, reinforce the idea that drinking is a key part of the college experience. Easy access to alcohol near campuses also contributes to this normalization.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Understanding these causes is essential to addressing the issue. By recognizing the pressures students face, we can work towards creating effective interventions and fostering a healthier, more supportive campus environment.</p>

     <section id="solutions">
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>Here are some ways to ultimately fix the drinking problem:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lowering the drinking age:</strong> The legal drinking age can contribute to binge drinking among college students by creating a sense of restriction, leading to psychological reactance—where people rebel against perceived limits on their freedom. For example, closing a social lounge during finals might prompt students to defy the rule. Lowering the drinking age to 18 could reduce binge drinking, as seen in countries like Germany and Italy, where young adults are exposed to alcohol in responsible social settings. According to the NIAAA, these countries experience fewer binge-drinking issues, suggesting that earlier exposure fosters responsible drinking habits and reduces long-term health risks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Offering programs:</strong> Another way to address alcohol misuse is by offering programs that help college students cope with alcohol withdrawals and excessive binge drinking. For example, the University of Missouri (Mizzou) provides a 
          <a href="https://wellbeing.missouri.edu/mental-health-appointments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wellbeing website</a> 
          where students can request support programs and access feedback on alcohol and drug use through a behavior profile. Therapists, psychiatrists, and specialists are also available on campus to assist students struggling with addiction and prevent self-harm or harm to others.
        </li>
      </ul>

   <section id="effects">
      <h2>Effects</h2>
      <p>Alcoholism affects academic performance, health, and relationships, creating long-term challenges for students.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <img src="fakeidimage.png" alt="Fake ID image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>Alcoholism is a problem here at Mizzou because students tend to find sneaky ways to get alcohol. One method is by using a fake ID, which involves someone completely altering their identity with fake credentials. This is strictly illegal and according to the MikeHamiltonLaw, getting caught can result in a fine of $1,000 and possibly a sentencing of 1 year in prison. Students are often peer-pressured into getting a fake ID by their friends, which ultimately leads to more fake IDs and students wanting to get their full worth of it. These students who have a fake ID buy and consume more alcohol since fake IDs aren’t cheap. According to Vice, an average fake ID costs somewhere around $100. The desire for fake IDs is constantly increasing as more students are wanting to fit into parties and enjoy their adult life.</p>
