      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Alcoholism among college students is a growing concern. This site explores its causes, effects, and potential solutions while also providing resources for those who may be struggling with alcohol addiction.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>Factors like peer pressure, stress, and the desire for social acceptance contribute to excessive drinking on campuses. Many fraternities have hazing and other methods that promote unsafe drinking.</p>
    </section>

     <section id="solutions">
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>Here are some ways to ultimately fix the drinking problem:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lowering the drinking age:</strong> The legal drinking age can contribute to binge drinking among college students by creating a sense of restriction, leading to psychological reactance—where people rebel against perceived limits on their freedom. For example, closing a social lounge during finals might prompt students to defy the rule. Lowering the drinking age to 18 could reduce binge drinking, as seen in countries like Germany and Italy, where young adults are exposed to alcohol in responsible social settings. According to the NIAAA, these countries experience fewer binge-drinking issues, suggesting that earlier exposure fosters responsible drinking habits and reduces long-term health risks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Offering programs:</strong> Another way to address alcohol misuse is by offering programs that help college students cope with alcohol withdrawals and excessive binge drinking. For example, the University of Missouri (Mizzou) provides a 
          <a href="https://wellbeing.missouri.edu/mental-health-appointments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wellbeing website</a> 
          where students can request support programs and access feedback on alcohol and drug use through a behavior profile. Therapists, psychiatrists, and specialists are also available on campus to assist students struggling with addiction and prevent self-harm or harm to others.
        </li>
      </ul>
